# Driftwood Stack ðŸŒŠðŸŽ¸

A simple, powerful, and developer-friendly monorepo stack designed for building Proof of Concepts (POC/MVP), AI Micro-SAAS and scalable small web applications with AI/Machine Learning components.

> **Note:** This stack is optimized for solo developers (Senior ones) or small teams. For larger teams or projects, consider breaking it into multiple repositories to facilitate scalability and collaboration.

## Project Overview

This project is organized into three main parts:

1. **Frontend**: Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [shadcn](https://shadcn.dev/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
2. **Backend**: Powered by Go and Python.
   - **API Gateway** (Go): Utilizes [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/), [Swaggo](https://swaggo.github.io/swaggo.io/), [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/), and the [MongoDB Go Driver](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/).
   - **ML Service** (Python): Employs [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [Loguru](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
3. **Infrastructure**: Managed with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI/CD.

## Progress

- [x] Basic General Setup
- [x] Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Basic Backend Setup (Go & Python, especially for AI implementations)
- [x] Basic Frontend Setup
- [ ] Implemented completely functional frontend and backend.
