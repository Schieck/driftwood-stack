# Driftwood Stack ðŸŒŠðŸŽ¸

A simple, powerful, and developer-friendly web, web3, monorepo stack designed for building Proof of Concepts (POC/MVP), AI Micro-SAAS and scalable small web applications with AI/Machine Learning components.

A few signs that could be useful for you:
- You're a senior testing something solo, and you knows that it has the entire setup ready, that if done manually would take some hours to build.
- The setup is complete for a basic operation, enabling customer access, and a special access for the admins.
- It already supports most of the things a UI/UX would ask you to implement.
- With the ability to quickly implement AI tools, it enables you to easily solve real world problems, instead of just creating a python script or something so specific that most people will never use.
- It uses gRCP communication between the two apis, so it's really fast.
- You can easily implement WEB3 tools if needed, such as wallets and other stuff.

> **Note:** This stack is optimized for solo developers (Senior ones) or small teams. For larger teams or projects, consider breaking it into multiple repositories to facilitate scalability and collaboration.

## Project Overview

This project is organized into three main parts:

1. **Frontend**: Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [shadcn](https://shadcn.dev/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
2. **Backend**: Powered by Go and Python.
   - **API Gateway** (Go): Utilizes [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/), [Swaggo](https://swaggo.github.io/swaggo.io/), [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/), and the [MongoDB Go Driver](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/).
   - **ML Service** (Python): Employs [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [Loguru](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
3. **Infrastructure**: Managed with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI/CD.

## Progress

- [x] Basic General Setup
- [x] Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Basic Backend Setup (Go & Python, especially for AI implementations)
- [x] Basic Frontend Setup
- [ ] Make to rename for the new project
- [ ] Finish first version of the component generator
- [ ] Adjust prompts for better results
- [ ] Implement CI/CD with artifacts ready for deploy
- [ ] Implemented completely functional frontend and backend using all the tools



## Getting Started

> Fork this project and start from it. 


### Pre-requisites
- A running python
- Support to run Makefiles
- A running docker

To run this template locally, execute the following command:

```bash
make start <name-of-your-project>
make docker-run
```

# Code Generation

The Driftwood Stack provides a code generation tool that helps you quickly scaffold components, services, and pages across different parts of the project. You can generate code either as blank templates or using AI assistance.

## Command Structure

```bash
make setup-generator
make component project=<project-type> level=<component-level> name=<component-name>
```

### Project Types
- `exposed-webapp`: Customer-facing Next.js application
- `internal-webapp`: Admin/Internal React application
- `api-gateway`: Go-based API services
- `ml-service`: Python-based Machine Learning services

### Component Levels
- Frontend (`exposed-webapp`, `internal-webapp`):
  - `atom`: Basic UI components
  - `molecule`: Composite components
  - `organism`: Complex UI sections
  - `template`: Page templates
  - `page`: Full pages
- Backend:
  - `service`: API or ML services
  - `model`: Data models (ML service only)
